Authentication Service
======================

Authentication tokens are generally needed for programmatic access to
our services. The AuthClient handles storing and
loading your token or tokens and inserting it into requests in other
clients.

We can access the auth client from ``client.auth``. Once you have saved
a token, you probably won’t interact with this client very often,
however it has some convenient features for saving new tokens the first
time. Let’s see if you have a token already. Probably not.

.. code:: python
    
    client = CAVEclient()
    auth = client.auth
    print(f"My current token is: {auth.token}")

.. _new-token:

Getting a new token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a new token, you will need to manually aquire it. For convenience,
the function ``get_new_token()`` provides instructions for how to get and
save the token.

By default, the token is saved to
``~/.cloudvolume/secrets/cave-secret.json`` as a string under
the key ``token``. This makes it compatible by default with
`Cloudvolume <https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume>`_ projects, which
can come in handy. The following steps will save a token to the default
location.

.. code:: python

    auth.get_new_token()

.. code:: python

    new_token = 'abcdef1234567890' #This is the text you see after you visit the website.
    auth.save_token(token=new_token)
    print(f"My token is now: {auth.token}")

Note that requesting a new token will invalidate your previous token on the
same project. If you want to use the same token across different computers,
you will need to share the same token information.

Loading saved tokens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Try opening ``~/.cloudvolume/secrets/cave-secret.json`` to see
what we just created.

If we had wanted to use a different file or a different json key, we
could have specified that in auth.save_token.

Because we used the default values, this token is used automatically
when we intialize a new CAVEclient. If we wanted to use a different
token file, token key, or even directly specify a token we could do so
here.

.. code:: python

    client = CAVEclient(datastack_name)
    print(f"Now my basic token is: {client.auth.token}")
    
    client_direct = CAVEclient(datastack_name, auth_token='another_fake_token_678')
    print(f"A directly specified token is: {client_direct.auth.token}")

If you use a CAVEclient, the AuthClient and its token will be
automatically applied to any other services without further use.
