## 7.0.0 (November 20, 2024)

- Simplified skeleton client interface to only accept formats of 'dict' and 'swc'

- Added endpoints for bulk skeleton retrieval and querying whether a skeleton exists or not.

## 6.4.1

- Fix networkx deprecation warning.

## 6.1.0

- Added support for inequality filters for numerical columns in materialization tables interface.

## 6.0.0 (October 14, 2024)

## 5.20.0 (April 8, 2024)

- Used new support to check that chunkegraph has updated version before using spatial bounds kwarg
  on client.chunkedgraph.level2_chunk_graph

## 5.18.0

- Added serialization support for pandas.index

## 5.17.3

- Added getting multiple schemas in one call to improve initialization of table_manager interface of materialization

## 5.16.1

- Add option to get expired versions to client.materialize.get_versions

## 5.12.1 (October 16, 2023)

- Bugfixes for client.chunkedgraph.get_latest_roots

## 5.12.0 (October 16, 2023)

- Improved logic for client.chunkedgraph.get_latest_roots to work forward or backwards in time

## 5.11.0 (September 19, 2023)

- Added filter_regex_dict options to client.materialize.query_table interface

## 5.10.2 (August 16,2023)

- Fixed pyarrow support for live_live query

## 5.10.1 (August 14,2023)

- Changed random_sample argument to be an integer number of annotations rather than a floating fraction of table
- Added option to live_query

## 5.9.0 (August 14, 2023)

- Added support for native pyarrow deserialization, allowing upgrade to pyarrow version

## 5.8.0

- Allowed int64 root ids to serialize properly
- Added warning that client.materialize.tables interface is in beta

## 5.7.0

- Fix to ensure stop_layer is at least 1
- Added client.chunkedgraph.suggest_latest_roots

## 5.6.0

- Added views to client.materialize.tables interface
- Added optional argument to allow invalid root ids when querying live live, versus creating an exception

## 5.5.1

- documentation fixes on client.materialize.join_query

## 5.5.0

- added methods for different neuroglancer state formats to client.state.

## 5.4.3

- Added 'view' querying options to materialization
- Added client.materialize.tables interface
- Added client.materialize.get_tables_metadata to get all metadata in one call

## 5.2.0

- Added local caching of datastack names > server_address to simplify initialization of clients
  with servers other than global.daf-apis.com.

Cache is saved on a local file ~/.cloudvolume/secrets/cave_datastack_to_server_map.json

Cache will populate the first time caveclient.CAVEclient('my_datastack', server_address="https://my_server.com")
is called. Subsequent calls can then just be caveclient.CAVEclient('my_datastack').

## 5.1.0

- Added get_oldest_timestamp call to chunkedgraph

## 5.0.1

- Fixed bug with desired_resolution being set at the client level
  was being ignored in >5.0.0

## 5.0.0

- Added support for the new CAVE Materialization 3.0 API
  Includes support for the new materialization API, which allows for
  server side conversion of the units of position, and ensures that
  all positions are returned with the same units, even after joins.
- Added support for querying databases that were materialized without merging
  tables together. This will allow for faster materializations.
- Removed support for LiveLive query from the Materialization 2.0 API client.
  Note.. <5.0.0 clients interacting with MaterializationEngine >4.7.0 servers will
  use live live query but will doubly convert the units of position if you ask
  for a desired resolution, as the old client will also do a conversion server side.
- Fixed interaction with api version querying of servers from individual
  clients to work with verify=False. (useful for testing)
- Stored infromation from client about mapping between dataframe and table names
  and original column names.
- Added support for suffixes and select columns to be passed by dictionary rather than list
  making the selection an application of suffixes more explicit when there are collisions
  between column names in joined tables.

## Older Upgrade Notes

Change all select_column calls to pass dictionaries rather than lists.
Change all suffix calls to pass dictionaries rather than lists.
Advocate for your server administrator to upgrade to MaterializationEngine 4.7.0 or later,
so you can use the new MaterializationEngine 3.0 API and client.
