# Installation

## Stable release

To install `networkframe`, run this command in your
terminal:

```console
pip install networkframe
```

This is the preferred method to install `networkframe`, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for `networkframe` can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

```console
git clone git://github.com/bdpedigo/networkframe
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

```console
curl -OJL https://github.com/bdpedigo/networkframe/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```console
pip install .
```

Or in editable mode, it can be installed with:

```console
pip install -e .
```
