JSON Neuroglancer State Service
===============================

We store the JSON description of a Neuroglancer state in a simple
database at the JSON Service. This is a convenient way to build states
to distribute to people, or pull states to parse work by individuals.
The JSON Client is at ``client.state``

.. code:: python

    client.state

Retrieving a state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JSON states are found simply by their ID, which you get when uploading a
state. You can download a state with ``get_state_json``.

.. code:: python

    example_id = 4845531975188480
    example_state = client.state.get_state_json(test_id)
    example_state['layers'][0]

Uploading a state
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also upload states with ``upload_state_json``. If you do this,
the state id is returned by the function. Note that there is no easy way
to query what you uploaded later, so be VERY CAREFUL with this state id
if you wish to see it again.

*Note: If you are working with a Neuroglancer Viewer object or similar,
in order to upload, use viewer.state.to_json() to generate this
representation.*

.. code:: python

    example_state['layers'][0]['name'] = 'example_name'
    new_id = client.state.upload_state_json(example_state)

.. code:: python

    test_state = client.state.get_state_json(new_id)
    test_state['layers'][0]['name']

Generating a Neuroglancer URL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have a state ID, you want to turn it into a well-formatted link.
So you don't have to remember all the endpoints, we can do this from the state client.

.. code:: python

    ngl_base = 'neuromancer-seung-import.appspot.com'
    client.state.build_neuroglancer_url(new_id, ngl_base)

Note that the neuroglancer base can be found in the info service under ``client.info.viewer_site()``.
