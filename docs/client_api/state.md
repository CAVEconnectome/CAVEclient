!!! note
    The functionality described here will be accurate if the datastack you are using is using the most up-to-date version of the JSON  state service. If something seems wrong with the documentation here, try checking the version of the JSON state service returned by your client:
    ```python
    type(client.state)
    ```
    Extended documentation for all versions of the state client can be found
    [here](../extended_api/jsonservice.md).
