Note: the functionality described here will be accurate if the datastack you are using
is using the most up-to-date version of the state engine. If something seems
wrong with the documentation here, try checking the version of the state
engine returned by your client:

```python
type(client.state)
```

Extended documentation for all versions of the state client can be found
[here](../extended_api/state.md).
