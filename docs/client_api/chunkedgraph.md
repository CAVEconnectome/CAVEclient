!!! note
    The functionality described here will be accurate if the datastack you are using is using the most up-to-date version of the chunkedgraph service. If something seems wrong with the documentation here, try checking the version of the chunkedgraph returned by your client:
    ```python
    type(client.chunkedgraph)
    ```
    Extended documentation for all versions of the chunkedgraph client can be found
    [here](../extended_api/chunkedgraph.md).
