# client.l2cache

Note: the functionality described here will be accurate if the datastack you are using
is using the most up-to-date version of the level-2 cache. If something seems
wrong with the documentation here, try checking the version of the level-2 cache returned by your client:

```python
type(client.l2cache)
```

Extended documentation for all versions of the level-2 cache client can be found
[here](../extended_api/l2cache.md).
