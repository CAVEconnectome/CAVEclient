CAVE is short for Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine. CAVE is a set of microservices
that provide a framework for storing and versioning connectomics data and large sets of
dynamic annotations, metadata, and segmentations. This repository supplies client-side
code to easily interact with the microservices in CAVE.
