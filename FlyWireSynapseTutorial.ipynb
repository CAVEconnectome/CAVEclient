      "Synapses in this table consist of a pre- and a postsynaptic point (in nm), confidence scores, and neurotransmitter information. \r\n",
      "The synapses were predicted by Buhmann et al [1] for the v14 alignment of the FAFB dataset. The FlyWire team remapped these synapses into the v14.1 space used by FlyWire with an accuracy of <64nm (therefore, this is a potential source of error). This version of the Buhmann et al. synapses was trained on the initial training set from the calyx and performance varies across brain areas accordingly.\r\n",
      "Buhmann et al. assigned two scores to their synapses representing different measurements of confidence. The “connection_score” column contains the scores assigned by them during prediction (higher is more confident) and “cleft_score” contains the scores acquired by Buhmann et al. by using the synapse segmentation from Heinrich et al. [2] (higher is more confident). For the latter, Buhmann et al. found the highest value in Heinrich et al.’s segmentation along the line between the pre- and postsynaptic point for each synapse. This represents an individual assessment of the validity of each synapse because Buhmann et al. found synapses without using the segmentation by Heinrich et al.. Buhmann et al. suggested using the product of both scores, others found that the “cleft_score” alone with a threshold of 50-100 to be a good filter. We suggest validating analyses with various thresholds.\r\n",
      "Some synapses were (falsely) annotated multiple times. We found that most of these can be fixed by merging synapses between the same partners that are <150nm apart on the presynaptic side. The threshold might vary for different cell types and again we suggest validating analyses with various thresholds.\r\n",
      "Eckstein et al. [3] developed a classifier to predict probabilities for each of six neurotransmitters for each synapse (sum to 1, Dopamine (DA), Acetylcholine (ACh), Glutamate (Glut), Octopamine (OCT), Serotonin (SER), Gabaergic (GABA)). Davi Bock, Gregory Jefferis and Eric Perlman contributed infrastructure to run their classifier on all synapses from Buhmann et al. . For some synapses (<20k) no neurotransmitter information could be acquired. Probabilities for these have been set to all 0. Additionally, the “valid_nt” column can be used to filter these out (False=no neurotransmitter information available). Improving this classifier through the acquisition of additional ground truth is actively worked on. The classifications of ACh, GABA and Glu appear to be more robust than DA, OCT and SER in this version. Additionally, there was little training data from the optic lobe and results are more robust in the central brain. \r\n",
