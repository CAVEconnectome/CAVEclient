CAVE is short for Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine. CAVE is a set of microservices
that provide a framework for storing and versioning connectomics data and large sets of
dynamic annotations, metadata, and segmentations. This repository supplies client-side
code to easily interact with the microservices in CAVE.

A full description of the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine can be found [in this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.26.550598v1).

## Installation

`CAVEclient` can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install caveclient
```

To add optional dependencies (currently for interfacing with the segmentation, imagery,
and some skeleton formats via cloud-volume), you can install with the following:

```bash
pip install caveclient[cv]
```

## Python version support

Currently we are officially supporting and testing against Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.
