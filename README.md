CAVE is short for Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine. CAVE is a set of microservices
that provide a framework for storing and versioning connectomics data and large sets of
dynamic annotations, metadata, and segmentations. This repository supplies client-side
code to easily interact with the microservices in CAVE.

A full description of the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine can be found [in this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.26.550598v1).
